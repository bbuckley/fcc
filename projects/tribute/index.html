<div class="container-fluid">Quotes by Hayek</div>
  <ul>
     <li>The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.</li>
    <li>Freedom granted only when it is known beforehand that its effects will be beneficial is not freedom.</li>

<li>Intellects whose desires have outstripped their understanding.</li> 

<li>We know: of course, with regard to the market and similar social structures, a great many facts which we cannot measure and on which indeed we have only some very imprecise and general information.</li>

    <li>To act on the belief that we possess the knowledge and the power which enable us to shape the processes of society entirely to our liking, knowledge which in fact we do not possess, is likely to make us do much harm.</li>

  </ul>
